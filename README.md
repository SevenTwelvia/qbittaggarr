* **"Forever" Override:** Manually add a forever tag to any torrent to give it infinite seeding time and ratio.
* **Speed Limits:** COMING SOON. Apply download/upload speed limits based on tag.
* **Name Keywords:** COMING SOON. Automatically assign any tag you want based on keywords found in a torrent's name.
